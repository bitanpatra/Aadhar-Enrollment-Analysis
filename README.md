# Aadhaar Enrolment Pattern Analysis

This project analyzes Aadhaar enrolment patterns in India using UIDAI-provided enrolment data. The objective is to understand how enrolments vary across time, geography, and age groups, and to convert raw public data into clear, interpretable insights.

The analysis focuses on:
- Monthly enrolment trends
- State- and district-level geographic distribution
- Age-group composition of enrolments

The project includes structured data cleaning, aggregation, and exploratory analysis performed using Python, along with an interactive Power BI dashboard for visualization.
